# PricingDecisions

- Here i tried to implement the design pattern "Strategy" as a task solution:


   *) PricingBehavior Interface is the main Strategy
   
    ->   SellerBehavior Class is a concrete Strategy which is about seller in SuperMarket
   
    ->   PricingBehavior Class is a concrete Strategy which is about customer in SuperMarket
   
 
   *) Person is the main context
     
    ->   Customer is a concrete context which is about customers in SuperMarket
    
    ->    Seller is a concrete context which is about sellers in SuperMarket
    
    
- As Java 8 functionality, i used the "Default Methods".
